# ZCLIP.js

A javascript implementation of ZCL over IP.

## Work in progress

Definitely a work in progress. Current tasks are:

- Generate cluster classes and commands from SiLabs application meta data
- Create examples and callable cli examples
- Implement OTA server example

## Supported Clusters

- OnOffCluster

## Installation

```sh
git clone ssh://git@stash.silabs.com/iot_software/zclip.js.git
cd zclip.js
npm install
```

## Usage

You can use this library for development or via cli commands for sending quick zclip commands to devices.

### CLI

CLI commands are located in `/cli`

```sh
./cli/blink <deviceIp>
```

### Development

Examples are located in `/examples`

```sh
var coap = require('coap');
var zcl = require('../.')(coap);

var onOffCluster = new zcl.OnOffCluster({
  ip: '::1',
  endpoint: 1
});

onOffCluster.toggle();
```

## Supported clusters and commands

{{#each clusters}}
- {{name}}
  {{#each commands}}
  * {{name}}
  {{/each }}
{{/each }}

## Run the tests

```sh
npm test
```
